- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
    Rust. Moving to something strongly typed and memory safe is my next goal. I would like to create servers and leverage frameworks like Tauri to make better apps. I am also diving into Helix. I've tried Neovim previously, but the keybindings in Helix are much more intuitive to me. And the fact that I don't have to spend a few hours trying to get an LSP to work also makes me happy inside, not unlike a recently fed duckling.

- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
  When I was going through my programming boot camp, building skills that would eventually lead to better places, I utilized Ke$ha to focus. I am not exagerrating when I tell you that I've listened to "Die Young" on repeat for hours while working on projects.
